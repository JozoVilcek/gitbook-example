# GitBook Usage Example

This is an example on how [GitBook](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook)
 can be used to produce nice book or documentation for projects. This
 example was born while I was discovering gitbook's gems and treasures.

## How to run it?

Everything is managed by gradle. To build documentation run:

```
cd gitbook-example
./gradlew clean buildDocs
```

Generated book will appear in `./build/docs/` folder.
